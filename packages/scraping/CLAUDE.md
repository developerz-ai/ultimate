# @ultimat3/scraping — boundary

Tier 5. May import tiers 0-4. Never sideways, never upward.

| Rule | Detail |
|---|---|
| Exports | `src/index.ts`, explicit, no `export *` — and complete enough that a third party implements `ScrapeDriver` from it alone. A driver author needing a deep import means the seam is not a seam |
| Errors | `src/errors.ts` owns the codes and their **retry classification**; `src/error-throws.ts` owns one constructor per failure mode |
| Files | one responsibility each, tests beside the source |
| Dependencies | `@ultimat3/core`, `@ultimat3/jobs`, `@ultimat3/schema`, `@ultimat3/storage`. **No third-party runtime dependency at all** |

Commands: `bun test`, `bunx tsc --noEmit -p tsconfig.json`.

## Tier 5, and why not lower

`jobs` is tier 3 and `storage` is tier 1, so today's imports would allow tier 4. It sits at 5
because `recover: 'agent'` is designed to import `@ultimat3/ai` (tier 4), and a package at 4 cannot
import a package at 4. Moving up later would be a table change with consumers already attached.

The cost is real and worth stating: `cli` is also tier 5, so `x scrape` will need a declared
`cli -> scraping` edge in `scripts/lib/tiers.ts`. Not declared yet — nothing imports this package.

## puppeteer-core is NOT a dependency

`docs/idea/18-build-vs-wrap.md` permits a library at a driver/transport seam only. This package
goes one step further and takes **no** dependency: `cdp-port.ts` declares the library's shape
structurally, and the app passes its own `puppeteer` in (`localBrowser({ launcher: puppeteer })`)
— the same shape as `s3Driver({ client })` taking an `S3ClientLike`.

Verified `As of 2026-08` on **Bun 1.3.14 with puppeteer-core 25.8.0 against headless Chrome 150**:
both `launch()` and `connect({ browserWSEndpoint })` work, including the WebSocket upgrade that
Playwright's `connectOverCDP` cannot perform under Bun (oven-sh/bun#9911) — which is why puppeteer
is the intended library and Playwright is not.

**No puppeteer type may appear outside `cdp-port.ts`, `cdp-target.ts`, `cdp-snapshot.ts`,
`cdp-fake.ts` and `driver-cdp.ts`.** `ScrapePage`, `ScrapeTarget` and `ScrapeDriver` are the
vocabulary, and a `Page`, `ElementHandle` or `CDPSession` reaching them makes the seam decorative.

## NEVER `mock.module('puppeteer-core')`

Observed failure: `mock.module` replaces the module for the whole run, `bun test` does not fully
serialise test files, and a mock installed in one file leaked into a concurrently-running file's
assertions. Use the **injected launcher** instead — `cdp-fake.ts`'s `fakeCdpLauncher()` is a value,
and a value cannot leak. `driver-parity.test.ts` runs the real driver's code path through it.

## The rules this package enforces on itself

| Rule | Enforced by |
|---|---|
| no wait outside `clock.ts` | `clock-discipline.test.ts` scans `src/*.ts` for `setTimeout`/`setInterval`/`Bun.sleep`. `http.ts` is pinned as the one exception, for one `AbortSignal.timeout` handed to the platform's `fetch` |
| the fake never drifts from the real driver | `driver-parity.test.ts` runs one suite against `fake`, `fixture` and the puppeteer path, and pins the one honest divergence (no layout engine offline, so no box and no hit-target) |
| an unrecorded request throws | `html-target.ts` and `http-recorded.ts` — an offline driver that fell through to the network would make a green suite secretly live |
| `allowHosts` is enforced, never advisory | `intercept.ts` is the single decision, asked by every driver AND by the HTTP leg, before a byte leaves |
| Chrome is never needed for `bun test` | `fakeBrowser`/`fakePage` run on Bun's own `HTMLRewriter` |

## Logging

Structured lines go through `ctx.logger` (core's `Logger`) — this package ships **call sites and a
field vocabulary, never a sink**. `ScrapeEventFields` is a CLOSED type, which is the mechanism that
keeps a session cookie out of a log line: there is no key to put one in. Secrets are additionally
boxed by core's `Secret`, and sessions are summarised by `sessionDigest()` — counts and an origin,
never a value.

## Secrets and sessions

- `secrets:` on the definition holds **names**; values are resolved in the worker, per attempt.
- A `Secret` typed into a page **taints** it: `screenshot()` and `pdf()` then refuse
  (`X_SCRAPE_SECRET_EXPOSED`). Pixels cannot be redacted after the fact; `page.html()` can, and is.
- A session is credential material: tenant-scoped key, never logged, never an artifact.
- `X_SCRAPE_AUTH_FAILED` is registered `terminal`, so `executeJob` dead-letters it on the attempt
  that threw it (`packages/jobs/src/retry-classification.ts` — `nextRetryForError`). It ALSO writes
  a refusal into the session record, which is a different distance: `restorableSession()` reads it
  before `driver.open()`, so a replay or a manual requeue refuses without spending a browser, a CDP
  attach or a request. The classification makes it terminal; the tombstone makes it cheap.
- The classification is load-bearing, not documentation: `classifyThrown` honours a `terminal` only
  for a code that is REGISTERED, so every owned code goes through `registerErrorRetry` in
  `errors.ts` — `errors.test.ts` fails if one is added without a classification.
