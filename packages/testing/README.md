# @ultimat3/testing

The harness. Never mock the database — clone it. Never assert on wall-clock time — advance the
frozen clock. Never let a test reach the network unmocked — it fails by design.

## What it owns

| Module | Owns |
|---|---|
| `harness.ts` | `describeApp()` / `testApp()` — boot an app in-process with its own database |
| `template-db.ts` | N workers, N databases, one migrated template, `CREATE DATABASE ... TEMPLATE` |
| `determinism.ts` | frozen clock, seeded RNG, seeded uuids, `assertDeterministic` |
| `sealed-network.ts` | any unmocked egress fails, with the URL and the mock line |
| `factories.ts` | typed factories from the entity registry, seeded |
| `test-types.ts` | the six test types and their helpers |
| `matchers.ts` | `toBeUltimateError` `toDenyPolicy` `toEmitSteps` `toMatchOpenApi` `toBeWithinBudget` `toRejectInput` |
| `fixtures.ts` | the registry + `test('…', ({ clock }) => …)` injection |
| `fixture-{clock,mail,jobs}.ts` | the three fixtures the framework owns |
| `preload.ts` | the bunfig preload that installs all of the above |

## Install

```toml
# bunfig.toml
[test]
preload = ["@ultimat3/testing/preload"]
```

## Fixtures

`test` from this package passes a fixture bag as the first argument, and builds only what the
body destructures — a test that never names `runJobs` never starts a queue.

```ts
import { expect, test } from '@ultimat3/testing';

test('the three-day sleep releases the worker', async ({ clock, runJobs }) => {
  await runJobs(onboardOrg, { orgId });
  expect(await runJobs.inFlight()).toBe(0);   // suspended, not waiting
  clock.advance('3d');
  expect(await runJobs.due()).toBe(1);
});
```

| Fixture | Is | Registered by |
|---|---|---|
| `clock` | `now()` · `advance('3d')` · `set(instant)` on the frozen clock | the preload |
| `mail` | `outbox()` · `lastTo(address)` · `failOnce(mail)` over an in-memory transport | the preload |
| `runJobs` | a worker: call it to enqueue+drain, then `drain()` `due()` `inFlight()` `depth()` | the preload |
| anything else | whatever the app registers | the app's `scripts/test-setup.ts` |

An app adds its own with `defineFixtures` and widens the type by augmenting `Fixtures`:

```ts
defineFixtures({ seed: () => loadSeed, actorFor: () => actorFor });

declare module '@ultimat3/testing' {
  interface Fixtures {
    readonly seed: (name: string) => SeedHandle;
  }
}
```

Destructuring a name nobody registered fails with `X_TEST_FIXTURE_UNKNOWN`, which names the set
that *is* registered — never `undefined is not an object` from inside the body.

## The six test types

| Helper | Asserts | `x verify` step |
|---|---|---|
| `unitTest` | pure logic, no I/O | `unit` |
| `contractTest` | OpenAPI diff vs the committed spec, MCP exposure | `contract` |
| `liveTest` | exactly what each subscriber receives | `live` |
| `jobTest` | step sequence, retries, idempotency | `job` |
| `e2eTest` | Playwright incl. offline mode + SW update | `e2e` |
| `evalTest` | LLM output scoring against a threshold | `eval` |

Each helper prefixes the test name with its type (`job · onboards an org`), which is what
`bun test --test-name-pattern "job · "` selects — the six lines of `x verify` come from the tests
themselves, not from a directory convention.

## Parallel databases

```ts
const db = await acquireWorkerDatabase({ adminUrl, migrate });
// worker 0 -> ultimate_test_template_w0
// worker 1 -> ultimate_test_template_w1
```

The first worker creates the template under a Postgres advisory lock and migrates it once; every
worker then clones it copy-on-write. With no Postgres configured it falls back to PGlite, so
`bun test` works on a laptop with nothing installed.

## Sealed network

```
X_TEST_NETWORK_SEALED
  cause: POST https://api.stripe.com/v1/charges was not mocked (allowed hosts: none)
  fix:   mockFetch('https://api.stripe.com/v1/charges', () => new Response('{}')) — or allowHost('api.stripe.com') if it must be real
```

## Errors

`X_TEST_NETWORK_SEALED` `X_TEST_DB_UNAVAILABLE` `X_TEST_NONDETERMINISTIC` `X_TEST_FIXTURE_UNKNOWN`
