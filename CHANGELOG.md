# Changelog

All notable changes to Ultimate. Format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/); versions follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

Framework packages version in **lockstep** — a release bumps every package to the same version, in one commit, under one tag. Declare `@ultimat3/*` at `^<version>`, as `x new` writes, and let `bun.lock` pin the build; keep every one on the same version, since a mixed-version install is a combination nobody tested. See [PUBLISHING.md](PUBLISHING.md).

Semver applies from 1.0.0. A breaking change to a documented API needs a major — [Upgrading](https://github.com/developerz-ai/ultimate/wiki/Upgrading) says what "documented API" covers. From 23.0.0 on, each `BREAKING —` line names its migration as `(#N)` straight after the dash — row N of that major's `Entry by entry` table in Upgrading — and `bun run changelog-check` refuses a line without one (`X_DOC_MIGRATION_UNPAIRED`).

**Majors 1 through 30 were the pre-stability line**: shipped from 2026-08 under semver, often weeks apart, each with its edit in [Upgrading](https://github.com/developerz-ai/ultimate/wiki/Upgrading). v31 is the stable line: from it, at most one major every 90 days (`X_RELEASE_MAJOR_WINDOW`), breaking changes wait on `next` (`X_BREAKING_ON_MAIN`), and the previous major gets security fixes for six months — [Stability](https://github.com/developerz-ai/ultimate/wiki/Stability).

## [Unreleased]

### Highlights

- An island whose render throws keeps its server HTML instead of going blank (`mountOver`, used by `x g island`, `x new` and the resource form; the `island-mount-clears` guard finds older islands).
- Lighter documents and assets: the app brand ships in the stylesheet (about 6 kB less per themed page), immutable assets are compressed once in the background, a static export writes `.br`/`.gz` siblings, documents send a `Link` preload header, and cacheable SSR pages answer 304.
- Safer limits: an aborted or abandoned AI call is billed once the request is sent; MCP list tools answer a bounded page with a cursor; stdio cancellation works under load; a notification fan-out interrupted by a deploy no longer sends twice.

### Added

- `@ultimat3/render/client`: `mountOver(el, draw)` — an island's `mount` clears its server markup for the live render and puts it back when the render throws, then rethrows (the root is still marked `data-x-failed` and reported once through `clientErrors`). A throwing island shows its server HTML instead of a blank box. 167 B in a chunk; framework-neutral. `x g island`, `x new` and the resource form island write `return mountOver(el, (root) => render(() => <X {...props} />, root))`.
- `@ultimat3/cli`: the `island-mount-clears` guard (`x g guard island-mount-clears`; `x new` ships it). It finds an island that empties its own wrapper (`.textContent = ''`, `.innerHTML = ''`, `.replaceChildren()` on `mount`'s first parameter) outside `mountOver`; a clear of an element inside the wrapper is not read. The three tracked apps carry it and their islands mount over.
- `@ultimat3/core`: `islands.vendorSolid` in `app.config.ts` (default `false`): Solid built once as `/islands/vendor-solid.<hash>.js` and imported by every island. Pays only on a route rendering four or more Solid islands built apart — the vendor is 48,083 B (17,388 B gzip) where an island inlines ~14 kB; every Solid route of the three tracked apps grew 33,572–38,769 B with it on ([Client data](https://github.com/developerz-ai/ultimate/wiki/Client-Data#one-solid-for-every-island)).
- `x build`: `.x/build-stats.json` rows carry `requests` — `{ documents, scripts, styles, total }`, the fetches one document makes before it is whole. Reported, never budgeted.
- `x build --target static` writes `.br` (brotli 11) and `.gz` (gzip 9) siblings beside every island chunk and surface stylesheet over 1 KiB that a coding shrinks ([Static assets](https://github.com/developerz-ai/ultimate/wiki/Static-Assets#precompressed-siblings-in-a-static-export) names the host rules).
- `@ultimat3/mcp`: a projected list query's tool takes an optional `_after` argument and answers `truncated` + `nextCursor` when its page was cut short.

### Changed

- `@ultimat3/http`: an `immutable` asset is compressed once, in the background, at brotli 11 / zstd 19 / gzip 9 (`compress-precode.ts`, two keys at a time); every later hit is a lookup, brotli where the client accepts it (~28% smaller than zstd 3 on the demo stylesheet). A cached strong-ETag answer is coded once at zstd 9 / gzip 9 (the demo sheet 27,136 → 22,051 B).
- `@ultimat3/cli`: every document sends a `Link` header — its stylesheet as `rel=preload; as=style`, then each chunk its tags preload as `rel=modulepreload`, the same set — which a CDN turns into a 103 Early Hint.
- `@ultimat3/cli`: the app brand (`shared/theme.ts`) ships at the end of each surface stylesheet instead of an inline `<style>`: ≈ 6.1 KB less per themed document (the demo's `/` 18,389 → 12,244 B), no `style-src` hash, the same cascade.
- `@ultimat3/render`, `@ultimat3/cli`: a cacheable `ssr` document (anything but `no-store`) carries a strong content `ETag`, and `ssr`/`isr` answer `If-None-Match` with `304`.
- `@ultimat3/cli`: a static export's `/_img/` variants are named by the hash of their source bytes, width, format and encoder (framework + Bun version), not the source alone, so an upgrade that may re-encode never serves other bytes under an `immutable` name. Every `/_img/` URL changes once.
- `@ultimat3/cli`: an island build refuses a merged bundle in which an island imports a name its sibling chunk does not export — `X_BUILD_FAILED` naming the island and the chunk (`island-link-check.ts`), never a blank island in the browser; it runs over cached groups too.
- `@ultimat3/notify`: deliveries inside a 500-recipient chunk run 16 at a time (`NOTIFY_DELIVERY_WIDTH`), one failing recipient no longer stops its chunk: 100 recipients on a 50 ms channel 5.1 s → 0.36 s. A drain waits for every send already claimed before the step answers.
- `@ultimat3/pwa`: a precached asset is served from the precache — an offline document is styled, and a precached chunk is not downloaded twice. Each build's pages cache keeps at most 50 documents (`PAGES_CACHE_MAX`), oldest written first out.
- `@ultimat3/mcp`: a projected list query's tool answers one bounded page — 500 rows (`MAX_WIRE_PAGE_SIZE`) and 256 KiB of JSON — where it answered every row ([Upgrading](https://github.com/developerz-ai/ultimate/wiki/Upgrading)).
- `@ultimat3/mcp`: the stdio transport dispatches requests concurrently (≤ 16, `STDIO_MAX_IN_FLIGHT`; ≤ 64 more queued, `STDIO_MAX_QUEUED`), answers `ping` at once, and honours `notifications/cancelled` (the tool's `ctx.signal`, a hand-written tool's optional third `handle` argument) — at the cap too; `lineLimitBytes` counts bytes, not UTF-16 units.
- `@ultimat3/mcp`: `mcp.auth.missing-token` logs at `info` (MCP's own discovery starts unauthenticated); every `mcp.auth.*` line carries the address's network, never the full address; the unauthenticated failure allowance is per IPv6 /64.
- `@ultimat3/ai`: a call that stops early is billed against `tokensPerRun`, `costPerRun` and the actor and org ceilings: a stream abandoned, cut or aborted after the provider's first byte records the running usage the wire reported; a `generate` or `stream` aborted after its request was sent records the prompt's estimate. Only a call never sent, or refused by the provider, releases its reservation ([Upgrading](https://github.com/developerz-ai/ultimate/wiki/Upgrading)).
- `@ultimat3/ai`: a `postgresVectorStore` HNSW search returns `k` hits for a small tenant on a large shared table — `hnsw.iterative_scan = relaxed_order` on pgvector ≥ 0.8, else `hnsw.ef_search = max(40, k × 10)` — each search in a read-only transaction.

### Fixed

- `@ultimat3/mcp`: `mcpOAuthClient().begin` refuses an `authorization_endpoint` or `token_endpoint` that is not `https:` (`http:` only on a loopback host) as `X_MCP_REMOTE_REFUSED` — a `javascript:` endpoint made `authorizeUrl` a script link in the app's origin. It also refuses non-URL metadata and resource metadata naming another resource (RFC 9728 §3.3).
- `@ultimat3/cli`: a document's `Link` header screens each URL before wrapping it — a URL carrying its own `>;` could smuggle a second link to another origin past the check.
- `@ultimat3/ai`: a stream whose `done` record throws in the budget store is not booked a second time from the running bill (the cost and the actor credit were applied twice).
- `@ultimat3/ai`: a non-streamed 2xx answer that is not a JSON object, or is over 32 MiB, is `X_AI_PROVIDER_UNAVAILABLE`.
- `@ultimat3/notify`: a drain mid-chunk no longer answers the step while up to 16 sends are between claim and settle — those rows were left `sending` and re-sent by the retry after the reclaim window. The Postgres inbox's `add` returns the stored row under a concurrent writer; `memoryDeliveryLedger` no longer evicts a just-reclaimed or settled row.
- `@ultimat3/mcp`: the stdio reader no longer parks at the 16-call cap, where a `notifications/cancelled` or `ping` for a running call went unread.
- `@ultimat3/http`: a precoder that throws synchronously is logged (`http.precode_failed`), never an unhandled rejection of the background job.
- `@ultimat3/pwa`: a page refreshed while another write trims the pages cache is never the one trimmed — writes run one at a time.
- `@ultimat3/render`: a stream's `errorFallback` that throws falls back to the default `data-x-hole-error` markup and logs `render.stream.hole_fallback_failed`; it escaped as an unhandled rejection and the document never closed.
- `@ultimat3/scraping`: a CDP connection that closes answers every `once()` still waiting `false` at once and clears its timer, rather than at its deadline.

## Releases

| Version | Date | Summary |
|---|---|---|
| [31.14.0](docs/changelog/31.14.0.md) | 2026-11-12 | A deploy no longer reloads every live query: a replicator that stops cleanly hands over to its successor (change envelope v2), so sync nodes keep their windows; a crash still re-reads, once. Roll sync nodes before the replicator to get it on the first roll. |
| [31.13.1](docs/changelog/31.13.1.md) | 2026-11-12 | Security: the framework's lockfile resolves `source-map-js` 1.2.2 (GHSA-68fv-2mgg-jv7q). Not reachable through `@ultimat3/render` — `sass` declares it but never loads it — so an app needs only `bun update source-map-js` to clear `bun audit`. |
| [31.13.0](docs/changelog/31.13.0.md) | 2026-11-12 | An idle job queue costs a quarter of what it did: a worker on two queues, the outbox relay and the scheduler leader send 543 statements an hour, down from 2,418 — workers rest until the next due row instead of claiming every 5 s, counters are batched, and lease renewals are HOT updates. |
| [31.12.0](docs/changelog/31.12.0.md) | 2026-11-12 | A page no longer stays unstyled after one stylesheet fails during soft navigation: the router does a full load instead of swapping in a page whose CSS did not load, and keeps the previous sheets. |
| [31.11.0](docs/changelog/31.11.0.md) | 2026-11-12 | Security: a `native:` form answer and `uploadFlow` are host- and row-guarded — a refused form never redirects off this host, and an upload's policy judges the row it attaches to. |
| [31.10.0](docs/changelog/31.10.0.md) | 2026-11-12 | Security: `subjectErase` now reaches `<table>_history` — every image naming the erased person is purged in the parent's transaction, including rows deleted earlier and images a `set null`/`cascade` write records. An undeclared history table is `X_SUBJECT_TABLE_UNDECLARED`. |
| [31.9.0](docs/changelog/31.9.0.md) | 2026-11-12 | Set-based entity writes: `db.x.where(…).updateAll(patch)` / `.deleteAll()` is one statement, and `updateMany([{ id, patch }])` writes 1,000 different rows in one statement. |
| [31.8.0](docs/changelog/31.8.0.md) | 2026-11-12 | A rate-limit check writes no WAL: `x_rate_limit` is unlogged at fillfactor 70 (2 WAL records per take → 0). |
| [31.7.0](docs/changelog/31.7.0.md) | 2026-11-12 | Security: a sealed column no longer enters a history image (its lookup ciphertext was an equality oracle), and the authorization server enforces each client's registered grants and auth method. |
| [31.6.1](docs/changelog/31.6.1.md) | 2026-11-11 | After a deploy, a CDN can no longer hand a page an island chunk from the previous build: every island and `/_x/assets` script is named by a hash of its final bytes (#1075). |
| [31.6.0](docs/changelog/31.6.0.md) | 2026-11-11 | `contract-diff` compares against the manifest as committed, so `x manifest` or `x g` can no longer rebaseline a breaking change away before the gate sees it. |
| [31.5.0](docs/changelog/31.5.0.md) | 2026-11-11 | One address no longer meets 429 on a cold page load: built, content-hashed assets spend a new `assets` rate-limit bucket (2,000 burst, 200/s) instead of `default`. Measured: 180 of 300 island-chunk GETs from one address answered 429 before, 0 after. |
| [31.4.2](docs/changelog/31.4.2.md) | 2026-11-11 | `launchChrome` no longer gives up on a cold Chrome that has already opened its debugging port: the connection now gets what is left of the 60 s launch deadline, not the 10 s per-call one. |
| [31.4.1](docs/changelog/31.4.1.md) | 2026-11-11 | An island that throws an app error code ships about half the bytes: import `defineError` from `@ultimat3/core/page` (12,019 B → 6,507 B). |
| [31.4.0](docs/changelog/31.4.0.md) | 2026-11-11 | `ROLE=migrate` loads 104 fewer modules (977 → 873): the framework schema now reads the auth tables from the new `@ultimat3/auth/schema` leaf instead of the whole auth package. |
| [31.3.0](docs/changelog/31.3.0.md) | 2026-11-11 | Read one row's recorded history in write order with `history(db.postsHistory, id)`: versions numbered from 1, scoped to the tenant. |
| [31.2.0](docs/changelog/31.2.0.md) | 2026-11-10 | `x build` and `x exercise` honour `runtime.ts`: an audit sink declared there makes audited pages measurable and audited primitives reachable. |
| [31.1.0](docs/changelog/31.1.0.md) | 2026-11-10 | `x affected`, `x verify --changed` and `x test --affected` measure a change against `origin/main` by default, not a local `main` nobody pulled, and `bun test $(x affected --paths)` receives only paths. |
| [31.0.0](docs/changelog/31.0.0.md) | 2026-11-10 | **v31 is the stable line.** 74 breaking changes — most delete a second way to do one thing, the rest are security fixes and limits — each with its edit in [Upgrading](https://github.com/developerz-ai/ultimate/wiki/Upgrading#30x--3100-entry-by-entry). The next major comes no earlier than 2027-02-08, 90 days from today ([Stability](https://github.com/developerz-ai/ultimate/wiki/Stability)). |
| [30.9.0](docs/changelog/30.9.0.md) | 2026-11-09 | The test network seal is whole: every DNS resolver, `node:net`/`tls`/`http(s)`/`http2` and UDP are refused unless loopback, mocked or allowed — a test that reached the internet through one of them now fails, and `allowHost('<host>')` is the fix it prints. |
| [30.8.0](docs/changelog/30.8.0.md) | 2026-11-08 | Every primitive of a real app can be reached by `x exercise`: an entry can carry its call's cookies and headers, a job and an action of one name get separate entries, and a throwing entry is that primitive's record instead of the end of the pass. |
| [30.7.0](docs/changelog/30.7.0.md) | 2026-11-08 | `x exercise` runs at the size of a real app. A crash proof costs the same over 1,500 seeded rows as over 3: one job's proof cost a 504-primitive app most of a 172-minute pass. Every record and the report now say where the time went. |
| [30.6.0](docs/changelog/30.6.0.md) | 2026-11-08 | `x exercise` counts a job's own statements: never the jobs it queued, never jobs it found queued. A job that queues one child per row is no longer `X_QUERY_SCALES_WITH_ROWS`. |
| [30.5.0](docs/changelog/30.5.0.md) | 2026-11-08 | `x exercise` reports what a 5xx said, seeds a NOT NULL `json(t.json())` column, resolves mocked hosts under the sealed network, and names the step a crash-proof effect ran inside. |
| [30.4.0](docs/changelog/30.4.0.md) | 2026-11-07 | `x exercise` runs vendor-calling handlers for real under the sealed network: `defineExercise(overrides, { setup })` installs an app's `mockFetch` routes or `cassette()` for the pass. |
| [30.3.0](docs/changelog/30.3.0.md) | 2026-11-07 | `x exercise` seats a job in the tenant it is enqueued under, whatever field its `tenant(input)` reads: no more `X_JOB_TENANT_MISMATCH` (and `X_TENANCY_ACTOR_MISMATCH` inside) on a job whose org field the id binder did not recognise. |
| [30.2.0](docs/changelog/30.2.0.md) | 2026-11-07 | `seo: { llms: false }` hands `/llms.txt` to the app: an app serving its own no longer fails to boot with `X_ROUTE_CONFLICT`. |
| [30.1.0](docs/changelog/30.1.0.md) | 2026-11-07 | `x exercise` seeds a table with your own `defineFactory`, so an entity whose rows no generated value satisfies — a cross-column `satisfies`, a JSON column with required keys — runs the gate's `exercise` step. |
| [30.0.0](docs/changelog/30.0.0.md) | 2026-11-07 | One major for the whole of plan 101: every breaking change below lands here once, each with its edit in [Upgrading](https://github.com/developerz-ai/ultimate/wiki/Upgrading). |

## Older releases

`10.0.0` and everything before it are **in git history, not in this file**. No length cap is
enforced: trimming is a deliberate edit that deletes the oldest `## X.Y.Z` sections, because a
changelog nobody scrolls to the bottom of is a changelog nobody reads, and every deleted line is
one `git show` away.

| Want | Run |
|---|---|
| one past release's section | `git show v10.0.0:CHANGELOG.md` — or any tag; every release from 1.0.0 on is tagged |
| when a line was written, and by whom | `git log -p --follow -- CHANGELOG.md` |
| the whole file as it stood at the last full release | `git show v13.0.0:CHANGELOG.md` |
| what a major broke, without git | [`wiki/Upgrading.md`](https://github.com/developerz-ai/ultimate/wiki/Upgrading) — it walks **every** major, oldest first, and is deliberately NOT truncated |

**The upgrade guide is the one that has to stay complete**, and it does: a reader upgrading across
four majors needs every walkthrough in order, where a reader of this file wants the last release.
Two documents, two jobs — `bun run changelog-check` reads the oldest `## X.Y.Z` heading still here
as the retention boundary and stops demanding a section below it, so trimming this file again is
deleting sections and nothing else.
