# Changelog

All notable changes to Ultimate. Format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/); versions follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

Framework packages version in **lockstep** — a release bumps every package to the same version, in one commit, under one tag. Declare `@ultimat3/*` at `^<version>`, as `x new` writes, and let `bun.lock` pin the build; keep every one on the same version, since a mixed-version install is a combination nobody tested. See [PUBLISHING.md](PUBLISHING.md).

Semver applies from 1.0.0. A breaking change to a documented API needs a major — [Upgrading](https://github.com/developerz-ai/ultimate/wiki/Upgrading) says what "documented API" covers. From 23.0.0 on, each `BREAKING —` line names its migration as `(#N)` straight after the dash — row N of that major's `Entry by entry` table in Upgrading — and `bun run changelog-check` refuses a line without one (`X_DOC_MIGRATION_UNPAIRED`).

**Majors 1 through 30 were the pre-stability line**: shipped from 2026-08 under semver, often weeks apart, each with its edit in [Upgrading](https://github.com/developerz-ai/ultimate/wiki/Upgrading). v31 is the stable line: from it, at most one major every 90 days (`X_RELEASE_MAJOR_WINDOW`), breaking changes wait on `next` (`X_BREAKING_ON_MAIN`), and the previous major gets security fixes for six months — [Stability](https://github.com/developerz-ai/ultimate/wiki/Stability).

## [Unreleased]

### Highlights

- New commands: `x token` (API keys), `x config show` (redacted), `x logs tail`, `x cache graph|bust|clear`, and `x explain <query>` (plans what a query actually sends, never against production).
- `x g cron-job|purge|webhook-receiver`; a new `unbounded-fanout` guard; `repo-raw-sql` catches row comparisons, advisory locks and column-list selects.
- `x verify plan` turns the gate into CI parts, and `x new`'s workflow runs them in parallel then merges; `x exercise` now runs route `load`s and its crash proof is ~40% faster; `/readyz` pings the database at most once a second; boot warnings only appear in the roles they concern.

### Added

- `x verify plan [--parts n] --json`: the gate cut into CI parts, as data — each part an `x verify --only <steps> [--shard i/n]` for one runner, `data.matrix` a GitHub `strategy.matrix` (`{ include: [{ part, only, shard?, needs }] }`). `--parts` is `1` or `4`–`64` (default `4`: `static`, `e2e`, a `unit,contract,job` shard and a `live` shard); `needs` is `none`, `database` or `services`. Derived from the gate's step list, so a new step lands in a part with no workflow edit, and every step sits in exactly one part or every shard of one split — what `x verify merge` checks.
- `x token create|list|revoke`, `x config show`, `x logs tail`, `x cache graph|bust|clear` and `x explain <query>` ship (they exited `X_NOT_IMPLEMENTED`). `x token` issues an MCP/API key with exact scopes (the plaintext printed once), lists an owner's and revokes one; `x config show [--section <key>]` prints the resolved `app.config.ts`, credentials redacted; `x logs tail [--lines n] [--role <role>]` reads `.x/dev.log` or a role's log as the `logs.tail` MCP tool does; `x cache graph` prints the tag graph off the manifest and `bust <tag>` / `clear` run `invalidateTags` through the app's own tiers and bus; `x explain` runs one query on the dev database and plans every statement it sent with the `exercise` step's oracle, and refuses an external `DATABASE_URL` whose environment reads as production (`X_EXPLAIN_PRODUCTION_DATABASE`) — the query is sent with its policy skipped. `x token create`'s label defaults to the environment's (`prod` / `stage` / `dev`, an unreadable `ULTIMATE_ENV` reading as `prod`); `x cache bust|clear` boot as any CLI command does, never taking the migration lock or running framework DDL. `x token grant` and `x cache stats` stay planned.
- `x g cron-job`, `x g purge` and `x g webhook-receiver`: the one call of `cronJob()`, `purge()` and `webhookReceiver()` with its tests, listed in `apps/web/api/index.ts` — the receiver's job also gets its `apps/web/exercise.ts` entry, a verified-shape event, since no draw can sign one. The receiver verifies a timestamped HMAC over `<unix seconds>.<body>` (headers `x-signature` + `x-signature-timestamp`, assumed — the vendor's docs decide) and refuses a delivery signed outside a five-minute window as its own `X_<NAME>_STALE`, so a captured request cannot be replayed later; its test proves it. Why every other factory has no generator is `FACTORY_GENERATORS` in `packages/cli/src/generate-factories.ts`, held complete against `PRIMITIVE_FACTORIES` by its test.
- A shipped guard, `unbounded-fanout` (`X_UNBOUNDED_FANOUT`): `Promise.all(rows.map(… db/tx/…Repo …))`, async callback or not, over a list under `apps/` or `packages/` opens a statement per row at once; the fix names `mapBounded(rows, fn, { width })` from `@ultimat3/core`, and a `// why:` admits a list bounded where it is built. `x new` writes it; `x g guard unbounded-fanout` adds it.
- `app.config.ts`: `database.slowStatementMs` — the production `db.statement.slow` line's threshold (unset: 500 ms, as before; `0` is off; a non-whole or negative figure is `X_CONFIG_INVALID`).
- Every container boot logs `boot.phase { role, name, ms }` as each phase ends — `services`, `app-load`, `app-checks`, `build-id`, `web`, `roles` — so a slow start names its step.
- `x exercise` runs every `app/` and `site/` route `load` after the primitives, once, as the runtime calls it, with the primitives' statement-ceiling, scale and plan proofs; the records are `routes[]` in `.x/exercise.json` and `--json`. Every finding on a route load is a warning line, never red.
- `x exercise`: a primitive reached that sent no statement and had no effect — its proofs are vacuous — is named on one `X_EXERCISE_EMPTY_REACH` warning line, with the `exercise.ts` edit that fixes it.

### Changed

- A container boot logs each boot warning only in the roles it concerns: a worker, scheduler or sync node no longer repeats the web role's idempotency-store and MFA-secret warnings, the no-authenticator warning is the web role's, and a per-process rate-limit store is said once per process and only where a declared limit is spent (web, worker, sync). The roles each warning concerns are one table (`serve-boot-warnings.ts`); a new warning does not compile until it names them.
- `/readyz` sends at most one database ping per second (`READINESS_PROBE_MIN_MS`), however many pollers ask.
- `x new`'s `.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs the gate in parts read from the plan: a `plan` job (`bun run verify plan --parts 4 --json`), one `gate` job per part by `fromJSON` — `bun run setup`, the services its `needs` names, `bun run verify --only … [--shard …] --json`, the document uploaded red or green — and a `verify` job that runs `bun run verify merge`. No hand-written matrix. This repository's own `ci.yml` is held to `verifyPlan(7)` by a test.
- `x upgrade` prints the installed `x doctor`'s warnings (`data.warnings[]`, `X_VERIFY_STEP_UNFLOORED` among them) — one `doctor warning:` line each, `data.doctorWarnings` in `--json` — and they still never red the hop.
- The `repo-raw-sql` guard reports a `select` of a plain column list as it does `select *` (its fix projects with `.select({ id: true, … })`), a hand-written row comparison (`(a, b) < (?, ?)`, fixed by `keyset()`) and `pg_advisory_xact_lock` (fixed by `lockKeys`) in any repo statement, splices a quoted literal into the handle call as its value (`where({ status: 'published' })`), and names the chain write — `.where({ … }).andWhere(…).deleteAll()` / `.updateAll({ … })` — for an update or delete whose predicate holds a range, where it named `deleteWhere`, which takes equalities only. An app takes it with `x g guard repo-raw-sql --force`.
- `x exercise`: `.x/exercise.json` holds the same `warnings` as `--json`.
- `@ultimat3/db`: `slowStatementLog({ thresholdMs })` refuses a threshold that is not a finite number (`finiteOption`); `NaN` silently switched the line off.
- `@ultimat3/testing`: adopter G's three plan-sweep query shapes are regression fixtures on both engines (`plan-oracle-adopter-g.test.ts`); the index advice they misfired on was fixed in 30.8.0.

### Fixed

- `x dev`: an embedded data directory that will not open is set aside as `<dir>.unopenable-<UTC>` — renamed, never deleted — and the boot starts an empty one and says so (`X_DEV_DATA_UNOPENABLE`, fix `x db migrate`). The boot used to fail with `X_DB_UNAVAILABLE`, whose fix was the command that had just failed.
- `x exercise`: the crash proof's killed reruns run on the pass's frozen clock, so a `backfill()` throttle moves the instant instead of sleeping its `rate` in wall time — the reference app's pass from 23.3 s to 13.6 s.

## Releases

| Version | Date | Summary |
|---|---|---|
| [31.16.0](docs/changelog/31.16.0.md) | 2026-11-13 | `x exercise` is fairer and stricter: a refused test-seed table is one finding instead of every check going unproven, one call is held to 100 statements (loops declared with `expectedQueryLoop` excluded), and a data-dependent branch no longer reads as an N+1. `x.verify.json` `exercise.unprovenMax` / `statementsMax` floors are red when declared, warnings otherwise. |
| [31.15.0](docs/changelog/31.15.0.md) | 2026-11-12 | An island whose render throws keeps its server HTML instead of going blank (`mountOver`, used by `x g island`, `x new` and the resource form; the `island-mount-clears` guard finds older islands). |
| [31.14.0](docs/changelog/31.14.0.md) | 2026-11-12 | A deploy no longer reloads every live query: a replicator that stops cleanly hands over to its successor (change envelope v2), so sync nodes keep their windows; a crash still re-reads, once. Roll sync nodes before the replicator to get it on the first roll. |
| [31.13.1](docs/changelog/31.13.1.md) | 2026-11-12 | Security: the framework's lockfile resolves `source-map-js` 1.2.2 (GHSA-68fv-2mgg-jv7q). Not reachable through `@ultimat3/render` — `sass` declares it but never loads it — so an app needs only `bun update source-map-js` to clear `bun audit`. |
| [31.13.0](docs/changelog/31.13.0.md) | 2026-11-12 | An idle job queue costs a quarter of what it did: a worker on two queues, the outbox relay and the scheduler leader send 543 statements an hour, down from 2,418 — workers rest until the next due row instead of claiming every 5 s, counters are batched, and lease renewals are HOT updates. |
| [31.12.0](docs/changelog/31.12.0.md) | 2026-11-12 | A page no longer stays unstyled after one stylesheet fails during soft navigation: the router does a full load instead of swapping in a page whose CSS did not load, and keeps the previous sheets. |
| [31.11.0](docs/changelog/31.11.0.md) | 2026-11-12 | Security: a `native:` form answer and `uploadFlow` are host- and row-guarded — a refused form never redirects off this host, and an upload's policy judges the row it attaches to. |
| [31.10.0](docs/changelog/31.10.0.md) | 2026-11-12 | Security: `subjectErase` now reaches `<table>_history` — every image naming the erased person is purged in the parent's transaction, including rows deleted earlier and images a `set null`/`cascade` write records. An undeclared history table is `X_SUBJECT_TABLE_UNDECLARED`. |
| [31.9.0](docs/changelog/31.9.0.md) | 2026-11-12 | Set-based entity writes: `db.x.where(…).updateAll(patch)` / `.deleteAll()` is one statement, and `updateMany([{ id, patch }])` writes 1,000 different rows in one statement. |
| [31.8.0](docs/changelog/31.8.0.md) | 2026-11-12 | A rate-limit check writes no WAL: `x_rate_limit` is unlogged at fillfactor 70 (2 WAL records per take → 0). |
| [31.7.0](docs/changelog/31.7.0.md) | 2026-11-12 | Security: a sealed column no longer enters a history image (its lookup ciphertext was an equality oracle), and the authorization server enforces each client's registered grants and auth method. |
| [31.6.1](docs/changelog/31.6.1.md) | 2026-11-11 | After a deploy, a CDN can no longer hand a page an island chunk from the previous build: every island and `/_x/assets` script is named by a hash of its final bytes (#1075). |
| [31.6.0](docs/changelog/31.6.0.md) | 2026-11-11 | `contract-diff` compares against the manifest as committed, so `x manifest` or `x g` can no longer rebaseline a breaking change away before the gate sees it. |
| [31.5.0](docs/changelog/31.5.0.md) | 2026-11-11 | One address no longer meets 429 on a cold page load: built, content-hashed assets spend a new `assets` rate-limit bucket (2,000 burst, 200/s) instead of `default`. Measured: 180 of 300 island-chunk GETs from one address answered 429 before, 0 after. |
| [31.4.2](docs/changelog/31.4.2.md) | 2026-11-11 | `launchChrome` no longer gives up on a cold Chrome that has already opened its debugging port: the connection now gets what is left of the 60 s launch deadline, not the 10 s per-call one. |
| [31.4.1](docs/changelog/31.4.1.md) | 2026-11-11 | An island that throws an app error code ships about half the bytes: import `defineError` from `@ultimat3/core/page` (12,019 B → 6,507 B). |
| [31.4.0](docs/changelog/31.4.0.md) | 2026-11-11 | `ROLE=migrate` loads 104 fewer modules (977 → 873): the framework schema now reads the auth tables from the new `@ultimat3/auth/schema` leaf instead of the whole auth package. |
| [31.3.0](docs/changelog/31.3.0.md) | 2026-11-11 | Read one row's recorded history in write order with `history(db.postsHistory, id)`: versions numbered from 1, scoped to the tenant. |
| [31.2.0](docs/changelog/31.2.0.md) | 2026-11-10 | `x build` and `x exercise` honour `runtime.ts`: an audit sink declared there makes audited pages measurable and audited primitives reachable. |
| [31.1.0](docs/changelog/31.1.0.md) | 2026-11-10 | `x affected`, `x verify --changed` and `x test --affected` measure a change against `origin/main` by default, not a local `main` nobody pulled, and `bun test $(x affected --paths)` receives only paths. |
| [31.0.0](docs/changelog/31.0.0.md) | 2026-11-10 | **v31 is the stable line.** 74 breaking changes — most delete a second way to do one thing, the rest are security fixes and limits — each with its edit in [Upgrading](https://github.com/developerz-ai/ultimate/wiki/Upgrading#30x--3100-entry-by-entry). The next major comes no earlier than 2027-02-08, 90 days from today ([Stability](https://github.com/developerz-ai/ultimate/wiki/Stability)). |
| [30.9.0](docs/changelog/30.9.0.md) | 2026-11-09 | The test network seal is whole: every DNS resolver, `node:net`/`tls`/`http(s)`/`http2` and UDP are refused unless loopback, mocked or allowed — a test that reached the internet through one of them now fails, and `allowHost('<host>')` is the fix it prints. |
| [30.8.0](docs/changelog/30.8.0.md) | 2026-11-08 | Every primitive of a real app can be reached by `x exercise`: an entry can carry its call's cookies and headers, a job and an action of one name get separate entries, and a throwing entry is that primitive's record instead of the end of the pass. |
| [30.7.0](docs/changelog/30.7.0.md) | 2026-11-08 | `x exercise` runs at the size of a real app. A crash proof costs the same over 1,500 seeded rows as over 3: one job's proof cost a 504-primitive app most of a 172-minute pass. Every record and the report now say where the time went. |
| [30.6.0](docs/changelog/30.6.0.md) | 2026-11-08 | `x exercise` counts a job's own statements: never the jobs it queued, never jobs it found queued. A job that queues one child per row is no longer `X_QUERY_SCALES_WITH_ROWS`. |
| [30.5.0](docs/changelog/30.5.0.md) | 2026-11-08 | `x exercise` reports what a 5xx said, seeds a NOT NULL `json(t.json())` column, resolves mocked hosts under the sealed network, and names the step a crash-proof effect ran inside. |
| [30.4.0](docs/changelog/30.4.0.md) | 2026-11-07 | `x exercise` runs vendor-calling handlers for real under the sealed network: `defineExercise(overrides, { setup })` installs an app's `mockFetch` routes or `cassette()` for the pass. |
| [30.3.0](docs/changelog/30.3.0.md) | 2026-11-07 | `x exercise` seats a job in the tenant it is enqueued under, whatever field its `tenant(input)` reads: no more `X_JOB_TENANT_MISMATCH` (and `X_TENANCY_ACTOR_MISMATCH` inside) on a job whose org field the id binder did not recognise. |
| [30.2.0](docs/changelog/30.2.0.md) | 2026-11-07 | `seo: { llms: false }` hands `/llms.txt` to the app: an app serving its own no longer fails to boot with `X_ROUTE_CONFLICT`. |
| [30.1.0](docs/changelog/30.1.0.md) | 2026-11-07 | `x exercise` seeds a table with your own `defineFactory`, so an entity whose rows no generated value satisfies — a cross-column `satisfies`, a JSON column with required keys — runs the gate's `exercise` step. |
| [30.0.0](docs/changelog/30.0.0.md) | 2026-11-07 | One major for the whole of plan 101: every breaking change below lands here once, each with its edit in [Upgrading](https://github.com/developerz-ai/ultimate/wiki/Upgrading). |

## Older releases

`10.0.0` and everything before it are **in git history, not in this file**. No length cap is
enforced: trimming is a deliberate edit that deletes the oldest `## X.Y.Z` sections, because a
changelog nobody scrolls to the bottom of is a changelog nobody reads, and every deleted line is
one `git show` away.

| Want | Run |
|---|---|
| one past release's section | `git show v10.0.0:CHANGELOG.md` — or any tag; every release from 1.0.0 on is tagged |
| when a line was written, and by whom | `git log -p --follow -- CHANGELOG.md` |
| the whole file as it stood at the last full release | `git show v13.0.0:CHANGELOG.md` |
| what a major broke, without git | [`wiki/Upgrading.md`](https://github.com/developerz-ai/ultimate/wiki/Upgrading) — it walks **every** major, oldest first, and is deliberately NOT truncated |

**The upgrade guide is the one that has to stay complete**, and it does: a reader upgrading across
four majors needs every walkthrough in order, where a reader of this file wants the last release.
Two documents, two jobs — `bun run changelog-check` reads the oldest `## X.Y.Z` heading still here
as the retention boundary and stops demanding a section below it, so trimming this file again is
deleting sections and nothing else.
