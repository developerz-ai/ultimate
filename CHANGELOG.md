# Changelog

All notable changes to Ultimate. Format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/); versions follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

Framework packages version in **lockstep** — a release bumps every package to the same version, in one commit, under one tag. Declare `@ultimat3/*` at `^<version>`, as `x new` writes, and let `bun.lock` pin the build; keep every one on the same version, since a mixed-version install is a combination nobody tested. See [PUBLISHING.md](PUBLISHING.md).

Semver applies from 1.0.0. A breaking change to a documented API needs a major — [Upgrading](https://github.com/developerz-ai/ultimate/wiki/Upgrading) says what "documented API" covers. From 23.0.0 on, each `BREAKING —` line names its migration as `(#N)` straight after the dash — row N of that major's `Entry by entry` table in Upgrading — and `bun run changelog-check` refuses a line without one (`X_DOC_MIGRATION_UNPAIRED`).

**Majors 1 through 30 were the pre-stability line**: shipped from 2026-08 under semver, often weeks apart, each with its edit in [Upgrading](https://github.com/developerz-ai/ultimate/wiki/Upgrading). v31 is the stable line: from it, at most one major every 90 days (`X_RELEASE_MAJOR_WINDOW`), breaking changes wait on `next` (`X_BREAKING_ON_MAIN`), and the previous major gets security fixes for six months — [Stability](https://github.com/developerz-ai/ultimate/wiki/Stability).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- `@ultimat3/entity`: `.latestBy(group, { order, direction? })` ends a read chain with the newest row of every group in one `DISTINCT ON` statement — ties to the primary key, more than `MAX_LATEST_GROUPS` (1,000) groups `X_INVARIANT_VIOLATED`, never truncated. `preload(rel, { perParent: n, order?, direction? })` attaches at most `n` rows of a `hasMany` per parent in one `LATERAL` statement per 500 parents. A repository without `latestBy` answers both through paged `findMany` reads.
- `@ultimat3/entity`: `countBy(column, { where })` counts only the rows each group has that satisfy `where` (a group with none is present at `0`), and `.aggregate({ name: { fn, column?, where? } })` answers up to `MAX_MEASURES` (32) filtered measures in one `count(*) filter (where …)` statement. A `defineDriver` store composes both from the capabilities it already declares.
- `@ultimat3/entity`: `indexes:` entries take `expression` (`unique(lower(email))`), `orders` (a direction per key), `include` (btree `INCLUDE`) and `operatorClass: 'gin_trgm_ops'`; each absent by default, so no index name or schema hash moves. `x db gen` creates `pg_trgm` in the migration that first needs it.
- `@ultimat3/entity`: `entity({ version: 'lockVersion' })` — an optimistic lock. `update(id)` must carry the version, is conditioned on it and increments it; moved since the read is `X_ENTITY_STALE` (409), omitted `X_ENTITY_VERSION_INVALID`. `updateMany` checks every row (one stale row refuses the batch); `updateWhere`/`updateAll`/`transition`/soft delete increment it and may not set it; `upsertAll` with `onMatch: 'update'` is refused on a versioned entity. On a `defineDriver` store a filtered write re-reads and retries a row another writer moved, so it increments without throwing stale.
- `@ultimat3/entity`: `db.<table>.lockKeys(keys, fn)` holds up to `MAX_LOCK_KEYS` (64) advisory keys for one transaction, taken in sorted order, so two callers naming the same keys in different orders never deadlock.
- `@ultimat3/entity`: `.all()` logs `entity.all.truncated` (`ALL_TRUNCATED`) in development and test when it dropped a next page and the chain named no `.limit(n)`; staging and production stay silent.
- `@ultimat3/entity`: `RegistryEntry.coveredIndexes` lists each implicit column index another index already leads with (`CoveredIndex`). Listed only — every one is still emitted.
- `@ultimat3/auth`: `AuthAdapter.getSessionWithUser?(id)` (type `SessionWithUser`) — `authenticate` reads the session and its user in one statement on `postgresAuthAdapter` (was two). Optional: an adapter without it makes the two reads.
- `@ultimat3/auth`: `AUTH_LOCKOUTS_STORAGE`, from `@ultimat3/auth/schema` and the barrel — `x_auth_lockouts` is created from this declared, logged storage setting, the one the framework schema's drift check compares.
- `@ultimat3/policy`: `scoped(policy, scope)` and `policyScope(policy, actor)` attach a rule's database filter — an AND-only list of `{ column, op, value }` — to a policy. Composing it into query reads is planned.

### Changed

- `@ultimat3/entity`: `contains` on a `text()`/`char()` column is a case-insensitive substring match — a bound, escaped `ilike` (`%` and `_` literal), served by a `gin_trgm_ops` index — on Postgres and memory alike. Before, Postgres refused the statement and memory compared for equality. `jsonb` and arrays keep `@>`. The plan sweep's `X_QUERY_UNINDEXED` names the trigram declaration (`trigramDeclaration(col)`).
- `@ultimat3/entity`: a `countedIn` counter's trigger write is reported as an `entity.row` `update` of the parent on memory and Postgres (PGlite in `x dev` included), so a live count moves without a recount.
- `@ultimat3/entity`: `defineDriver` refuses a child entity whose column declares `countedIn` when `database()` builds it (`X_DRIVER_UNSUPPORTED`, `meta.capability: 'countedIn'`) — a custom store has no hook to move the parent's count, which used to stay unmoved silently.
- `@ultimat3/auth`: `registerClient` refuses a redirect URI, grant type, scope or resource that is empty or contains whitespace (`X_AUTH_CLIENT_INVALID`, 422): the store keeps each list space-joined, so such a value read back as a different list.
- `@ultimat3/jobs`: a concurrent `refreshView` no longer accepts a unique `expression` index as its key — Postgres refuses one (`X_JOB_REFRESH_VIEW_INVALID`).

### Fixed

- `@ultimat3/jobs` (security): `subjectErase` reaches a deleted or anonymized table's `<table>_history`, which must now be declared — `'delete'` removes every history row whose `before` or `after` image names the subject — rows deleted, soft-deleted or inserted before the erase included — in the parent's transaction (`x.purge` on Postgres, `purgingHistory` in memory), `{ retain }` keeps and counts the same rows; undeclared is `X_SUBJECT_TABLE_UNDECLARED`. A deleted table's step also purges, in its transaction, the image its delete's `on delete set null`/`cascade` records in a child's `'delete'`-declared history. Before, an erased person's data survived in history before and after images.
- `@ultimat3/admin`: an entity declaring `version:` can be updated from the admin and its MCP tool — the version column is read-only, an update carries the version it read, and a write that lost the race answers `stale` (409). Before, every such update was `X_ENTITY_VERSION_INVALID`.

## Releases

| Version | Date | Summary |
|---|---|---|
| [31.9.0](docs/changelog/31.9.0.md) | 2026-11-12 | Set-based entity writes: `db.x.where(…).updateAll(patch)` / `.deleteAll()` is one statement, and `updateMany([{ id, patch }])` writes 1,000 different rows in one statement. |
| [31.8.0](docs/changelog/31.8.0.md) | 2026-11-12 | A rate-limit check writes no WAL: `x_rate_limit` is unlogged at fillfactor 70 (2 WAL records per take → 0). |
| [31.7.0](docs/changelog/31.7.0.md) | 2026-11-12 | Security: a sealed column no longer enters a history image (its lookup ciphertext was an equality oracle), and the authorization server enforces each client's registered grants and auth method. |
| [31.6.1](docs/changelog/31.6.1.md) | 2026-11-11 | After a deploy, a CDN can no longer hand a page an island chunk from the previous build: every island and `/_x/assets` script is named by a hash of its final bytes (#1075). |
| [31.6.0](docs/changelog/31.6.0.md) | 2026-11-11 | `contract-diff` compares against the manifest as committed, so `x manifest` or `x g` can no longer rebaseline a breaking change away before the gate sees it. |
| [31.5.0](docs/changelog/31.5.0.md) | 2026-11-11 | One address no longer meets 429 on a cold page load: built, content-hashed assets spend a new `assets` rate-limit bucket (2,000 burst, 200/s) instead of `default`. Measured: 180 of 300 island-chunk GETs from one address answered 429 before, 0 after. |
| [31.4.2](docs/changelog/31.4.2.md) | 2026-11-11 | `launchChrome` no longer gives up on a cold Chrome that has already opened its debugging port: the connection now gets what is left of the 60 s launch deadline, not the 10 s per-call one. |
| [31.4.1](docs/changelog/31.4.1.md) | 2026-11-11 | An island that throws an app error code ships about half the bytes: import `defineError` from `@ultimat3/core/page` (12,019 B → 6,507 B). |
| [31.4.0](docs/changelog/31.4.0.md) | 2026-11-11 | `ROLE=migrate` loads 104 fewer modules (977 → 873): the framework schema now reads the auth tables from the new `@ultimat3/auth/schema` leaf instead of the whole auth package. |
| [31.3.0](docs/changelog/31.3.0.md) | 2026-11-11 | Read one row's recorded history in write order with `history(db.postsHistory, id)`: versions numbered from 1, scoped to the tenant. |
| [31.2.0](docs/changelog/31.2.0.md) | 2026-11-10 | `x build` and `x exercise` honour `runtime.ts`: an audit sink declared there makes audited pages measurable and audited primitives reachable. |
| [31.1.0](docs/changelog/31.1.0.md) | 2026-11-10 | `x affected`, `x verify --changed` and `x test --affected` measure a change against `origin/main` by default, not a local `main` nobody pulled, and `bun test $(x affected --paths)` receives only paths. |
| [31.0.0](docs/changelog/31.0.0.md) | 2026-11-10 | **v31 is the stable line.** 74 breaking changes — most delete a second way to do one thing, the rest are security fixes and limits — each with its edit in [Upgrading](https://github.com/developerz-ai/ultimate/wiki/Upgrading#30x--3100-entry-by-entry). The next major comes no earlier than 2027-02-08, 90 days from today ([Stability](https://github.com/developerz-ai/ultimate/wiki/Stability)). |
| [30.9.0](docs/changelog/30.9.0.md) | 2026-11-09 | The test network seal is whole: every DNS resolver, `node:net`/`tls`/`http(s)`/`http2` and UDP are refused unless loopback, mocked or allowed — a test that reached the internet through one of them now fails, and `allowHost('<host>')` is the fix it prints. |
| [30.8.0](docs/changelog/30.8.0.md) | 2026-11-08 | Every primitive of a real app can be reached by `x exercise`: an entry can carry its call's cookies and headers, a job and an action of one name get separate entries, and a throwing entry is that primitive's record instead of the end of the pass. |
| [30.7.0](docs/changelog/30.7.0.md) | 2026-11-08 | `x exercise` runs at the size of a real app. A crash proof costs the same over 1,500 seeded rows as over 3: one job's proof cost a 504-primitive app most of a 172-minute pass. Every record and the report now say where the time went. |
| [30.6.0](docs/changelog/30.6.0.md) | 2026-11-08 | `x exercise` counts a job's own statements: never the jobs it queued, never jobs it found queued. A job that queues one child per row is no longer `X_QUERY_SCALES_WITH_ROWS`. |
| [30.5.0](docs/changelog/30.5.0.md) | 2026-11-08 | `x exercise` reports what a 5xx said, seeds a NOT NULL `json(t.json())` column, resolves mocked hosts under the sealed network, and names the step a crash-proof effect ran inside. |
| [30.4.0](docs/changelog/30.4.0.md) | 2026-11-07 | `x exercise` runs vendor-calling handlers for real under the sealed network: `defineExercise(overrides, { setup })` installs an app's `mockFetch` routes or `cassette()` for the pass. |
| [30.3.0](docs/changelog/30.3.0.md) | 2026-11-07 | `x exercise` seats a job in the tenant it is enqueued under, whatever field its `tenant(input)` reads: no more `X_JOB_TENANT_MISMATCH` (and `X_TENANCY_ACTOR_MISMATCH` inside) on a job whose org field the id binder did not recognise. |
| [30.2.0](docs/changelog/30.2.0.md) | 2026-11-07 | `seo: { llms: false }` hands `/llms.txt` to the app: an app serving its own no longer fails to boot with `X_ROUTE_CONFLICT`. |
| [30.1.0](docs/changelog/30.1.0.md) | 2026-11-07 | `x exercise` seeds a table with your own `defineFactory`, so an entity whose rows no generated value satisfies — a cross-column `satisfies`, a JSON column with required keys — runs the gate's `exercise` step. |
| [30.0.0](docs/changelog/30.0.0.md) | 2026-11-07 | One major for the whole of plan 101: every breaking change below lands here once, each with its edit in [Upgrading](https://github.com/developerz-ai/ultimate/wiki/Upgrading). |

## Older releases

`10.0.0` and everything before it are **in git history, not in this file**. No length cap is
enforced: trimming is a deliberate edit that deletes the oldest `## X.Y.Z` sections, because a
changelog nobody scrolls to the bottom of is a changelog nobody reads, and every deleted line is
one `git show` away.

| Want | Run |
|---|---|
| one past release's section | `git show v10.0.0:CHANGELOG.md` — or any tag; every release from 1.0.0 on is tagged |
| when a line was written, and by whom | `git log -p --follow -- CHANGELOG.md` |
| the whole file as it stood at the last full release | `git show v13.0.0:CHANGELOG.md` |
| what a major broke, without git | [`wiki/Upgrading.md`](https://github.com/developerz-ai/ultimate/wiki/Upgrading) — it walks **every** major, oldest first, and is deliberately NOT truncated |

**The upgrade guide is the one that has to stay complete**, and it does: a reader upgrading across
four majors needs every walkthrough in order, where a reader of this file wants the last release.
Two documents, two jobs — `bun run changelog-check` reads the oldest `## X.Y.Z` heading still here
as the retention boundary and stops demanding a section below it, so trimming this file again is
deleting sections and nothing else.
